## What is it? What does it do?

This project is a web based interactive Dart service. It's meant to be a simple,
easy way for users to play with Dart on-line, in a zero-install, zero
configuration environment. It'll support an easy snippet sharing service.

## Project status

Beta - available to play with here: https://dartpad.dartlang.org/, but still a
work in progress.
