## How to change and add to Sample Gists

1) Update the samples first in the dartpad_examples repository: https://github.com/dart-lang/dartpad_examples

1) Create your own gist based on the existing samples.  Gist IDs can be found in the [index file](https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/blob/master/web/index.html#L54).
