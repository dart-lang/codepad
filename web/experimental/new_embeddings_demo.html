            <div class="disclaimer">
                This codelab is being used to test out some new features of DartPad! You may encounter bugs,
                malapropisms, annoyances, and other general weirdness. If that happens, please take a moment to
                <a target="_BLANK" href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/issues/new">fill out a bug report on
                    GitHub</a>
                and let us know. Feature requests and suggestions are also greatly appreciated.
            </div>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                You may notice some flutter_web tech being used in this codelab. It's a pre-release
                version that we're messing around with, so if you see something wonky or wonder why
                Feature X isn't working, don't assume that it'll look that way when Flutter Web is
                eventually released.
            </div>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                Also, this codelab is currently being developed and tested with Chrome. There may be
                (in the short term) features that work in some browsers and not others. If you encounter
                any, please feel free to file bugs using the link above.

            <p>
                <span class="code">Row</span> and <span class="code">Column</span> are two very important widgets in the
                Flutter universe. Want to put a <span class="code">Text</span> widget with a label next to another <span
                    class="code">Text</span> widget with the corresponding value? Use a <span class="code">Row</span>.
                Want to present multiple pairs of labels and values? That's a <span class="code">Column</span> full of
                <span class="code">Rows</span>. Forms with several fields, icons next to menu choices, buttons next to
                search bars, these are all places where <span class="code">Rows</span> and <span
                    class="code">Columns</span> get used,
            </p>
            <p>
                This codelab will walk you through how <span class="code">Rows</span> and <span
                    class="code">Columns</span> work. Because they're so similar, once you're done learning about <span
                    class="code">Rows</span>, the codelab mostly just shows you how all the same stuff applies to <span
                    class="code">Columns</span>. There are inline editors along the way so you can play around and test
                your knowledge.
            </p>

            <h3>Let's start with a Row and some children</h3>
            <p>
                The whole point of a <span class="code">Row</span> or <span class="code">Column</span> is to contain
                other widgets, known as children. In a <span class="code">Row</span>, children
                are arranged horizontally from first to last in accordance with text direction. If your device is set to
                English or another left-to-right language, they'll start from the left. If you're using Arabic or
                another right-to-left language, they'll start on the right and head left.
            </p>

            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                Below is a widget called <span class="code">MyWidget</span> that builds a single Row. Try adding three
                <span class="code">BlueBox</span> widgets to its list
                of children.
            </p>

            <p>
                The last step is to get those icons in place at the bottom of the card:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add four <span class="code">Icon</span> widgets to the last <span class="code">Row</span>'s list of
                    children. You can use whichever icon resources you
                    like, but these would be a good way to show that your imaginary developer focuses on accessibility,
                    fast development, and multi-platform apps:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.accessibility</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.timer</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.phone_android</span></li>
                    <li><span class="code">Icons.phone_iphone</span></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Set the <span class="code">Row</span>'s <span class="code">mainAxisAlignment</span> property to
                    <span class="code">MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround</span></li>
            </ul>
