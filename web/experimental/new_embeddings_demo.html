            <h2>Dart Cheat Sheet Codelab</h2>
            <p>
                Dart is designed to be easy to learn for coders coming from other languages, but it
                also has a few unique features that will be new to people learning it for the first
                time. This short codelab will walk you through the most important ones, and can be a
                handy place to return for a refresher as you grow your Dart skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to explanations and examples, the codelab includes embedded editors with
                partially completed code snippets. You can use these editors to test your knowledge
                by completing the code and clicking the "test" button.
            </p>
            <h3>String interpolation</h3>
            <p>
                Dart offers string interpolation to simplify formatting variables and expressions
                as strings. You can put the value of an expression inside a string by using
                <span class="code">${expression}</span>. If the expression is an identifier, you can
                skip the <span class="code">{}</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="code">'${3 + 2}'</span> becomes <span class="code">'5'</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code">'${"word".toUpperCase()}'</span> becomes
                    <span class="code">'WORD'</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="code">'$myObject'</span> becomes the value of
                    <span class="code">myObject.toString()</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Code example</h4>
            <p>
                The following function takes two integers as parameters. Add code to make it return
                a string containing both numbers separated by a space (e.g. 2 and 3 become '2 3').
